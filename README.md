## Step Monitoring System

This project analyzes data collected from a personal monitoring device over the course of two months, October and November, 2012. The device collected data at 5-minute intervals throughout the day, recording the number of steps the person took in each 5-minute interval.

The dataset is available as a zip file at http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip. After expanding this file, we end up with a csv file called "activity.csv". The variables in this dataset are:

* __steps__: Number of steps taken in a 5-minute interval
* __date__: The date on which the measurement was taken, in YYYY-MM-DD format
* __interval__: Identifier for the 5-minute interval
